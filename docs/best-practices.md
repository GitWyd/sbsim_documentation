# Best Practices

- **Modular Design**:

  - Keep modules and classes focused on single responsibilities.
  - Facilitate reuse and maintainability.

- **Error Handling**:

  - Use try-except blocks where exceptions might occur.
  - Provide meaningful error messages and log exceptions.

- **Logging**:

  - Use the `logging` module instead of print statements.
  - Set appropriate logging levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).

- **Documentation**:

  - Keep documentation up to date with code changes.
  - Use comments to explain complex logic or decisions.

- **Performance Optimization**:

  - Profile code to identify bottlenecks.
  - Optimize algorithms and data structures where necessary.

- **Configuration Management**:

  - Use configuration files (e.g., Gin) to manage parameters.
  - Avoid hardcoding values in the codebase.
