# Glossary

- **HVAC**: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning systems.
- **RL**: Reinforcement Learning.
- **TF-Agents**: A library for reinforcement learning in TensorFlow.
- **Setpoint**: The desired temperature or condition that a control system aims to maintain.
- **Regret Function**: A type of reward function that measures the difference between the actual performance and the optimal performance.
- **Gin Configuration**: A lightweight configuration framework for Python.
- **Productivity Decay Curve**: A function describing how productivity decreases as conditions deviate from optimal setpoints.
- **Energy Cost Models**: Models that calculate the cost and carbon emissions associated with energy consumption.
- **Normalization**: The process of scaling data to a standard range or distribution.
- **VAV**: Variable Air Volume systems used in HVAC to control the amount of air flow to different areas.
- **Control Volume**: A defined region in space through which fluid may flow in and out, used in simulations to model physical systems.
